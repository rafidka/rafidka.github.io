# Career Highlights

## Current Role: Member of Technical Staff @ Cohere

Building and improving **Compass**, an enterprise-grade retrieval platform that powers RAG pipelines. Key contributions include:

- Designed the **end-to-end evaluation framework** with retry mechanisms, checkpointing, and LLM-based evaluation for scalable IR experiments
- Shipped multiple integrations: **web2compass** for RAG-enabled documentation, **MCP tooling** for North, and **code2compass** for semantic code search
- Improved **Compass Parser efficiency** for vision-language models, achieving **50% memory reduction** in image-to-markdown tasks
- Led development of **Compass SDK V2** with async support and built the **Compass Asset Service** for scalable ingestion pipelines
- Implemented **Postgres-based job queue** replacing Celery for improved reliability in long-running jobs
- Contributed to open-source by adding **Cohere support to Pydantic-AI**

## Key Amazon/AWS Achievements

- **Founding engineer** on **Amazon Managed Apache Airflow (MWAA)**, leading design and launch at re:Invent 2020; scaled to **15+ global regions**
- Led modernization of the **Distributed Job Scheduler** backend using Elasticsearch, powering **large-scale scheduling across Amazon**
- Built platform services for **Amazon Mobile Shopping App** serving **millions of retail customers**
- Championed open source with **amazon-mwaa-docker-images** repository serving **thousands of MWAA environments**

## Systems & Low-Level Programming Background
